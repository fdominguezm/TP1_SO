For Compilation:
make clean && make all

For execution, there are three options:
1) ./application <files> | ./view

2) In two separate terminals you should run the following commands: 
    ./application <files>
    ./view <NUMBER OF FILES>
The number of files will be printed on STDOUT when you run the application.

3) You can also just run the ./application <files> 

In all of the above, teh results will be printed in the 'fresult.txt' files.
